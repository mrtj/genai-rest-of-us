    "# Question answering with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a practical example of how to build a question answering system using Retrieval Augmented Generation. To create a RAG-based Q&A tool, you need to do two main things: first, index your own set of documents for the system to use, and second, set up a way to retrieve the right documents when the application needs to answer a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of document indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing your documents involves several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gather the documents you want to use.\n",
    "2. Change these documents into simple text or markdown format.\n",
    "3. Break the text down into smaller parts called \"chunks\".\n",
    "4. Create document embeddings for these chunks.\n",
    "5. Load the embeddings into a vector store system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/rag_indexing.png \" alt=\"RAG indexing overview\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of document retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "At retrieval time, the system will calculate the embeddings of the query phrase. The vector store will look up for document chunks semantically similar to the query, based on k-nearest-neighbor search algorithm over the document embeddings. The most relevant document chunks will be passed to a large language model (LLM) together with the instruction to answer the original question based on the retrieved chunks."

They use a tool called a _tokenizer_ to break down the text and then measure its length in _number of tokens_ instead of characters. For instance, OpenAI models use a tokenizer known as `tiktoken`. To accurately determine the length of a prompt, it's essential to measure it in terms of the number of tokens. Fortunately, langchain is equipped with a feature that allows for measuring chunk lengths in terms of `tiktoken` token length."
